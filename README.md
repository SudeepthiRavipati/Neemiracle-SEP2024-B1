Pneumonia detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) involves building a model that can accurately classify whether a person has pneumonia or not based on chest X-ray images. The project uses a dataset containing labeled X-ray images, which are fed into a CNN model that learns to differentiate between healthy lungs and those affected by pneumonia. Various image preprocessing techniques and deep learning architectures are applied to improve the modelâ€™s performance, aiming to create an efficient diagnostic tool that aids healthcare professionals in identifying pneumonia early and effectively.

Steps Involved:

1.Data Collection

2.Data Preprocessing

3.Train Test Split

4.Model Training

5.Visualization

6.Accuracy
